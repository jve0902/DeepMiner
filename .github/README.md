## If you wanna a idea or way to dump the wasm file

Check this <https://github.com/juj/emsdk> and this <https://github.com/JayDDee/cpuminer-opt/tree/master/algo/cryptonight>

## If you wanna a bypass

Check the `crypto-js` and `crypto` package in npm. Why not make it amzing one by yourself.

## At last for my team guys

Once you find some intersting but not cearted by you: 
You can leaning how it work.
You can complete your ideas with it.
You can hacking it and you can share it.
But keep it NO-CHANGED what if not yours.
Don't give the word until some made by yourself in real.

Re-post some pictures bcs it's funny.
Don't forget the rules in this group dude.

1. Take for leaning and hack for fun.
1. Keep in evil but do action for kind.
1. Mark who help and never hidden.

Glad to meet you my teammate.
Happy coding and good luck :)
